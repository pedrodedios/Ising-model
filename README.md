## 🌟 Highlights

- This project provides a **Fortran implementation of the 2D Ising model**, simulated using the **Monte Carlo–Metropolis algorithm**.
- The code computes several fundamental thermodynamic observables of the system, including:
  - **Average energy** ⟨E⟩
  - **Specific heat** \(C_v\)
  - **Average magnetization** ⟨M⟩
  - **Magnetic susceptibility** $\chi_M$
- For a detailed overview of the Ising model and the measurement techniques used in this project, see the full documentation: **[ising.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24104401/ising.pdf)**
